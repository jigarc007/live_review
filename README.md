Use any DB and NodeJS framework of your choice
Create REST APIs to perform CRUD operations of notes
Store each review with id, title, content and date-time
Implement web-socket, which should broadcast whenever any review is getting added/edited/deleted
Frontend
We are only looking for decent UI, which can just work.
Please start with plain HTML first, do not worry about CSS. Complete rest of the functionalities and then if time permits, continue improving UI.
Please do not use any css framework like bootstrap, tailwind, etc.
You can use either React, Vue, Angular or vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
Inline styles not allowed.
Reviews List View (Default View, route = /)
A button to create new review - clicking on which user will be redirected to /new/ route
Basic Table layout with all reviews
Table should have 6 columns: #, Title, Content, Date-time, Edit, Delete
# - Static count number starting with 1
Edit - a edit button, clicking on which user will be redirected to /:id route
Delete - a delete button, clicking on which review will be deleted
Show each review in separate row
Latest review should be displayed first
This should be a live list view with implementation of web-socket, so whenever any review is added/edited/deleted, it should immediately update the table without user needing to refresh the page
New Review (route = /new)
1 input for title
1 textarea for content
Save button - saves the review, and redirects user back to list view, i.e. route /
Reset button - resets the review content and title
Cancel button - redirects user back to list view, i.e. route /
Edit Review (route = /:id)
Re-use the same component from New Review
Pre-fill the title and content from the existing review
Delete button - deletes the review, and redirects user back to list view, i.e. route /
